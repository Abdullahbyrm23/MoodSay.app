# moodsay

A new Flutter project.

This app is a mood indicator. Users click on the emoji mood they're currently feeling and receive a quote of the day. Each click brings up a different quote. Plus, they can also write a diary specifically for that day and their current mood. Goodbye, hoping to see you in good spirits.
